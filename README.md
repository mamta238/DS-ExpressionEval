Code for simple expression evaluator which contains the following:
1)The expression is entered in the form of infix string.
2)Checking the validity of expression using DFA logic.
3)Checking whether the paranthesis is balanced or not.
4)Once validity test is passed then the expression string is converted from infix to postfix(This takes care of precedence).
5)Then the string is parsed into numbers(int,float) and operators and stored in a linked list.
6)Once the string is parsed it is evaluated.
